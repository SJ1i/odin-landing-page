# Project: Landing Page <sub>for The Odin Project</sub>

---

## Introduction

For this project, I will be making a web page that resembles a generic home page by using HTML and CSS.

## Reflection

Upon completion of this project, I have demonstrated following skills:
- use semantic HTML tags to structure a web page and only use `<div>` for styling purpose.
- use CSS Flexible Box Layout to position elements and style a web page, which includes the use of following properties:
    - `display: flex;`
    - `flex-direction`
    - `justify-content`
    - `align-items`
    - `gap`
    - `flex`
- apply the value `auto` to `margin` property for positioning.
- use `border-radius` property to make round-corner boxes.
- modify list styles by using `list-style` property.
- modify link styles by selecting pseudo-classes `:visited` and using `text-decoration` property.
- reinforce the concept of CSS Box Model and utilize its corresponding properties.
